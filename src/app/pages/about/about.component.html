      <p> Hello visitor, my name is Leonardo Perrone and I am a young software developer that just started his career in
        this wonderful field. When I was younger, I felt a strong connection with technology and computers so I decided
        to pursue a degree related to this subject. A few years after, I completed a Bachelor’s of Science in Computer
        Engineering at Wichita State University in the sunflower state of Kansas. I was also able to complete a minor in
        Management Information Systems, which gave me my first exposure to relational databases and VB.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that software developers and engineers are not only the gears that make our world go on, but also the
        ones that show the world that nothing is impossible in terms of innovation. You think it, they’ll do it. With
        this in mind I hope that someday I will be part of the innovation that will affect the upcoming generations.
      </p>
